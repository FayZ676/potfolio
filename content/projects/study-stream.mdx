"Lectures get boring, and how can I expect to learn anything when I'm bored?"

As a person who has always struggled to stay focussed in meetings and zoom classes, it was the above question that lead me to build Study Stream one afternoon while zoning off in a school lecture.

Study stream transforms your zoom lectures into interactive chat sessions powered by AI.

Here are some cool ways i've used study stream to get more out of my meetings:

1. Get a condensed summary of the meeting.
2. Extract any questions that were asked.
3. Quickly identify any assignments that were given in the meeting.
4. Convert the meeting into content for a powerpoint presentation.

And there's so much more!!
